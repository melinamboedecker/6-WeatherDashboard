# 6-WeatherDashboard
Simple Calendar App

## Description:
This is a weather dashboard that allows a user to search for a city and get current weather conditions as well as a 5-day forecast for that city.  Cities a user searches for are stored in local storage and displayed in a sidebar and can be clicked to get data for that city again. This app uses the Open Weather Map API to retrieve weather data.  

This App was created with dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.  Bootstrap was utilized for layout.
